## terraform section

# (Please review screenshots folder for proofs)

in this section i created an ec2 instance from a given VPC

- region
- ami
- instance_type 
- ssh_key_name
- ssh_key_path
- security_group_name
- subnet_id

the created ec2 then uses a script that installs in it "docker" and "docker-compose"
